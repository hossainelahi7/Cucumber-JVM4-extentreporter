# Cucumber4ParallelRunLog
This is a sample code to Cucumber-JVM4 parallel run work with Cucumber JVM HTML reporter. 
Its Cucumber test running in Parallal
Running as basic Junit test
Using Nativ Junit reporting that can easility integrate to any other reporting tool if required.
Sharing test context and Java Objects through out different step file is also another challenge I tried to solve here.
